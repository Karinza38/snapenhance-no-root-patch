# SnapEnhance LSPatch
SnapEnhance is an Xposed mod that enhances your Snapchat experience.

This ***unofficial*** repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow for generating a Snapchat APK by using the [SnapEnhance Module](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance) and creating a public release.

Credit to [@hamzaharoon1314](https://github.com/hamzaharoon1314) and [@ABCPascal](https://github.com/ABCPascal) for much of the work.

- New release created for every workflow run
- Release version follows SnapEnhance

## How the Github Action works:

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the creation of a Snapchat Patch for Non-Root users. Here's how it works:

1. **Snapchat Download**: The action downloads the latest stable version of Snapchat from APKMirror.

2. **SnapEnhance Download**: It also fetches the latest version of SnapEnhance from the original repository.

3. **Patch Build**: The action then builds the patch version of Snapchat.

4. **Upload to Release**: Finally, it uploads the patch to a new GitHub Release with the first 3 parts of the version matching the SnapEnhance version.

## How to report issues

Do not report issues of these prebuilts in the official [SnapEnhance Telegram](https://t.me/snapenhance_chat). If you want me to help (@NicholasFlamy) then you need to open an issue on this repo. 

You could also make a post about it on [r/SnapEnhanceApp](https://reddit.com/r/SnapEnhanceApp) using the "Prebuilt Issue" post flair or make a post about it on the [SnapEnhance Lemmy Community](https://lemmy.world/c/snapenhance) mentioning that it's a prebuilt.
