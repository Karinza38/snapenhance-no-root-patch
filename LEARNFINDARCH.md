If you don't know what architecture -- arm64-v8a or armeabi-v7a -- to download, either download the **universal** apk (takes more storage space) or check out [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.andr7e.deviceinfohw), go to the SoC tab and look for ABI as it will show you which architecture your phone uses. If you have arm64-v9a that's an improvement to arm64-v8a so use arm64-v8a.
